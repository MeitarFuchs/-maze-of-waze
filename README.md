README:

The project is about a directed graph.
We realized it with 2 Hashmap, one for the vertex and a second is  for the edge. The vertex is represented with node who contains a key ,  location , weight ,info and a tag. The edge is represented by the vertex source and destination , a tag , info and a weight.
It have also a few algorithms about the graph ,for example: it can calculate the shortest path , you can also check if the graph is connected which means there is a valid path from every vertex to each other vertex ,you can save and load to file.
 The project has another option that allows you to draw the graph , and if you do an change in your graph (for example add a vertex) the drawing changes according to the new graph.
